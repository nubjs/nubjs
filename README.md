## nubjs

Created to be as close to a "kernel" of a platform for JS on the server. Any
frilly interface is left to the end user.

I welcome the community to contribute (though please read CONTRIBUTING.md), but
final architecture decisions are not a vote. nubjs has a very specific goal in
mind, and one that I'm not about to take the time to fully document just to not
be read.

-----

**Note:** Until such time as I deem this code minimally usable, expect the code
to be squashed periodically. There will be a lot of "Though the previous way
was better, but it's actually not" type commits, and they're pointless to have
during initial development.
